# Demand-Forescast-for-SKU
Given 3 years of sales data, predict demand for SKU of a retail store over the last 3 weeks of the year. Solving this problem can help businesses in efficient inventory management. It can also help to identify periods with high/low sales and special discounts can be given accordingly to boost sales during these periods. Can also view the impact of inflation on sales and whether it leads to a change in buying behaviour.

Algorithms used include ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA, Random Forest and XGBoost.

Next steps would be to get data at more granular level to understand the types of products being sold, demand for different types of products, most popular product and the price point of the products.
